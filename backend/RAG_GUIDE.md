# RAG System — Complete Beginner Guide 🚀

## What is RAG? (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you're a librarian. A kid walks in and asks: *"Do you have books about space rockets?"*

You don't read every book. Instead, you:
1. **Remember** where space books are shelved (that's the **vector database**)
2. **Understand** the kid's question means "astronomy/rockets" (that's **embedding**)
3. **Find** the closest matching books (that's **semantic search**)
4. **Explain** the answer in simple words (that's the **LLM generating a response**)

**RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation**
- **Retrieval** → Find relevant data from your database
- **Augmented** → Feed that data into an AI model
- **Generation** → AI writes a helpful answer using that data

## Real-World Analogy: Spotify Recommendations 🎵

| Spotify | Our RAG System |
|---------|---------------|
| Songs are stored as audio features (tempo, energy, mood) | Jobs are stored as vectors (meaning of title + description) |
| You play a song → Spotify finds similar songs | You type a query → We find similar jobs |
| Spotify uses audio features to compare | We use **cosine similarity** to compare vectors |
| Spotify shows "Songs Like This" | We show "Jobs Like This" |

---

## What is a Vector? (The Core Concept)

A **vector** is just a list of numbers that represents the **meaning** of text.

```
"Python Developer"  → [0.12, 0.85, 0.03, 0.67, ... 384 numbers total]
"Backend Engineer"   → [0.11, 0.82, 0.05, 0.69, ... 384 numbers total]  ← SIMILAR!
"Pizza Recipe"       → [0.91, 0.02, 0.78, 0.11, ... 384 numbers total]  ← VERY DIFFERENT!
```

Notice: "Python Developer" and "Backend Engineer" have **similar numbers** because they mean similar things. "Pizza Recipe" has **very different numbers**.

---

## What is Cosine Similarity? 🎯

Cosine similarity measures **how similar two vectors are** on a scale of 0 to 1.

### Real-World Example: Pointing Fingers

Imagine two people pointing in directions:
- **Both point North** → Cosine = 1.0 (identical direction = identical meaning)
- **One points North, other points East** → Cosine = 0.0 (completely different)
- **Both point roughly North-East** → Cosine = 0.85 (similar!)

### In Our Code

```python
# In qdrant_service.py, line 35:
vectors_config=VectorParams(size=VECTOR_SIZE, distance=Distance.COSINE)
#                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#                                              THIS tells Qdrant:
#                                              "Use cosine similarity to compare vectors"
```

**We don't calculate cosine ourselves** — Qdrant does it automatically when we search. We just tell it "use COSINE" when creating the collection.

### Where is Cosine Used?

| What | Where | Who Does It |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Collection created with `Distance.COSINE` | `qdrant_service.py` line 35 | Our code tells Qdrant |
| Actual cosine math happens | Inside Qdrant Cloud | Qdrant does it automatically |
| Score returned in results | `hit.score` (line 78, 99) | Qdrant returns 0.0 to 1.0 |

## What About Chunking? ✂️

In many RAG tutorials, you will hear about **"Chunking"** (splitting text into smaller pieces). 

### How are we doing chunking here?
**We aren't!** Here is why:

In our app, we embed the entire job listing like this:
```python
text = f"{job.title} {job.description}"
vector = embed_text(text)
```

**Why don't we chunk it?**
Embedding models have a **Token Limit** (usually 512 tokens, which is about 400 words). 
- If you try to embed a 10-page resume, the model will cut off the end and you lose data. In that case, you **must** chunk the text.
- Our job descriptions are typically short (under 400 words). Because they fit within the model's limit, we can just embed the whole thing as one single "chunk". This keeps our beginner code much simpler!

### If you wanted to add chunking later:
If you start storing massive 10-page job descriptions, you would use LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to cut the text into pieces, embed each piece separately, and store them all in Qdrant with the same `job_id`.

        │
        ├─→ db.query(Job).all()
        │   Reads all jobs from PostgreSQL
        │
        ├─→ For each job:

```

### Flow 2: Searching Jobs (Semantic Search)

```
User types "python backend jobs" → POST /rag/search
        │
        ▼
    routers/rag.py: semantic_search()
        │
        ▼
    qdrant_service.py: search_jobs("python backend jobs")
        │
        ├─→ embed_text("python backend jobs")
        │   Convert query to vector [0.11, 0.82, ...]
        │
        └─→ qdrant.query_points(query=vector)
                    │
                    │  Qdrant compares this vector against ALL stored
                    │  job vectors using COSINE SIMILARITY and returns
                    │  top 5 closest matches
                    ▼
              results.points = [
                {title: "Python Developer", score: 0.92},  ← 92% similar!
                {title: "Backend Engineer", score: 0.87},  ← 87% similar!
                {title: "Data Analyst", score: 0.45},      ← 45% similar
              ]
```

### Flow 3: RAG Q&A (The Full RAG Pipeline)

```
User asks "What Python jobs pay over 80k?" → POST /rag/ask
        │
        ▼
    rag_service.py: rag_job_search("What Python jobs pay over 80k?")
        │
        ├─→ STEP 1 — RETRIEVAL
        │   search_jobs("What Python jobs pay over 80k?")
        │   Returns top 5 matching jobs from Qdrant
        │
        ├─→ STEP 2 — AUGMENTATION
        │   context = "- Python Developer: Build APIs (Salary: 90000)
        │              - Backend Engineer: Python+Django (Salary: 85000)"
        │
        │   Prompt sent to LLM:
        │   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │   │ SYSTEM: You are a job search assistant.          │
        │   │ Use the following job listings to answer:        │
        │   │ Retrieved Jobs:                                  │
        │   │ - Python Developer: Build APIs (Salary: 90000)   │
        │   │ - Backend Engineer: Python+Django (Salary: 85000)│
        │   │                                                  │
        │   │ HUMAN: What Python jobs pay over 80k?            │
        │   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        └─→ STEP 3 — GENERATION
            Groq LLM (Llama 3.3) reads context + question and writes:
            "I found 2 Python jobs paying over 80k:
             1. Python Developer — $90,000
             2. Backend Engineer — $85,000"
```

## How to Build This Yourself — Learning Path

### Step 1: Understand Vectors (30 minutes)
- Google "word embeddings explained simply"
- Key idea: words with similar meaning → similar numbers

### Step 2: Try fastembed Alone (15 minutes)
```python
from fastembed import TextEmbedding
model = TextEmbedding("BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")
vector = list(model.embed(["Hello world"]))
print(len(vector[0]))  # 384 — that's your vector!
```

### Step 3: Set Up Qdrant Cloud (10 minutes)
- Go to https://cloud.qdrant.io → free account → create cluster → get URL + API key

### Step 4: Store and Search Vectors (30 minutes)
```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.models import Distance, VectorParams, PointStruct

client = QdrantClient(url="YOUR_URL", api_key="YOUR_KEY")

# Create collection
client.create_collection("test", vectors_config=VectorParams(size=384, distance=Distance.COSINE))

# Store a vector
client.upsert("test", points=[PointStruct(id=1, vector=your_vector, payload={"text": "hello"})])

# Search
results = client.query_points("test", query=your_query_vector, limit=3)
```

### Step 5: Add an LLM (20 minutes)
- Get a free Groq API key from https://console.groq.com
- Use langchain-groq to send search results + question → get an answer

### Step 6: Wire Into FastAPI (30 minutes)
- Create routes, schemas, and connect everything

## Keyword vs Semantic Search — Why RAG Wins

```
User searches: "I want to code websites"

KEYWORD SEARCH (SQL LIKE):
  SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE description LIKE '%code websites%'
  Result: NOTHING (no job has exact text "code websites")

SEMANTIC SEARCH (Our RAG):
  Converts "code websites" to a vector
  Finds vectors close to it:
     ✅ "Frontend Developer" (score: 0.89)
     ✅ "Full Stack Engineer" (score: 0.85)
     ✅ "Web Developer" (score: 0.82)
  It UNDERSTANDS meaning, not just words!
```

That's the power of RAG. 🎉
